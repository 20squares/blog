Governance Centralization.



The share of Ether staked by Coinbase and
LSTs such as Lido ("centralized" staking services) continues to grow
quite considerably
.  For the share of Ether staked by
individually-operated validators to outgrow centralized staking
services in the long term, one of two things must happen.  Either there
is a greater continuous influx of new solo stakers relative to
centralized services, or solo stakers reinvest relatively more of
their profits, en masse.  At present, due to economies of scale, solo
staking has at least as high a cost floor per node as centralized
staking, and less access to new capital flows.  So reducing issuance
requires solo stakers to essentially subsidize the protocol relative
to the yield available by validating for an LST.
