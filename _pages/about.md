This is the blog of [20\[\]](https://20squares.xyz), a for-profit company focused on employing compositional techniques to game theoretic modelling and mechanism design, with particular attention to crypto.

As research moves fast in crypto, this blog will serve as a repository for research that we are happy to share, but that is not yet sedimented or mature enough to be turned into a full-flagged academic paper.

## Collaborations

We are strong advocates of cooperation and we want to keep this blog as open and plural as possible. We plan to have guest posts by friends and colleagues working in the broader crypto ecosystem and beyond. Hopefully, they will start appearing soon. Feel free to ping us if you think you have something interesting to say that you want to see published here!
